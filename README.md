# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the **Sorting Visualizer** created by **Rohit Kumar Chaurasiya**. This web application visualizes different sorting algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to learn and understand the internal workings of sorting algorithms interactively.

## Features

- **Interactive Sorting Visualization**: Visualize the step-by-step process of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Animation Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the animation using the provided slider to either slow down or speed up the visualization.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualizer is responsive and works across various screen sizes, making it accessible on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Explanations Included**: In addition to the visualization, each sorting algorithm comes with an explanation and time/space complexity details to enhance your learning experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sorting algorithms and handling the animation.
- **Canvas API**: To dynamically create visual elements and animate them.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Quick Sort**

Each algorithm has been explained in detail in the application itself with links to external resources for further reading.
